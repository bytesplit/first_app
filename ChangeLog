  * .rvmrc, Gemfile, Gemfile.lock: 2 changes:  added rvmrc for correct gemset
  initialization. This was actually required by pow, which I test to replace
  passenger-pane.  Also the gemfiles have been updated to later versions of
  some gems.

  * Gemfile.lock: Updated gemfile to get things up and running with latest
  Rails. 

  * Gemfile: Updated gem file to require Rails 3.0.9. 

  * README.markdown: Is this for real. I guess I need to learn more about using
  git.
